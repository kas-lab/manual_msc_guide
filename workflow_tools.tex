\chapter{Workflow and Tools}\label{c:workflow-tools}

\textit{This section is inspired by the \href{https://biaslab.github.io/research/starter-guide/}{Starter's Guide for students at BIASlab research team} by Prof de Vries at the BIASlab group of TU Eindhoven.}

We work together asynchronously, using tools like MS Teams (for communication and data management) and github (for source code version control)

\section{MS Teams}

\subsection{Reporting: LaTeX and Overleaf}
The projectâ€™s final report should be written in LaTeX on Overleaf. You must get familiar with LaTeX early during your project, because we start writing the final report very soon after the start of the project.

\subsection{Reference management: Zotero}
After you join the KAS Lab team you will also get access to our literature collection that we store online in a Zotero repository. This will help you get an overview of all relevant papers in our field.
